Kernel Module Examples

http://www.ittc.ku.edu/kusp/new/howto/kmods/index.html

These kernel module examples were created for students in the graduate
level operating systems class (EECS 750). As an academic exercise, we
showed them some basic ways of creating pseudo-device drivers. We
started with the old IOCTL interface, moved to using SYSFS, and built
off of that to make an example using HRTimers.

The purpose of these, combined information on the website, was to give
the students more and more comlpex examples with less explanation. The
idea being they'd grow more self sufficient and learn incorporate the
pertinent subsystems into their own projects.
